This is a small library intended to help with data cleaning. It differs from (d)plyr and tidyr in that it's not so much for reshaping data as it is for forcing the data to assume a measure of sanity. 

To that end, it includes functions to cross-check data, ease merging of discordant datasets, bulk update, and a function that is a sort of hybrid between str() and summary().
